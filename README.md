# Login Flow Confetti

Humorously inspired by [SteveMo](https://twitter.com/SteveMoForce/status/1135590776036057089),
I developed a [Login Flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.securityImplGuide.meta/securityImplGuide/security_login_flow_create.htm)
that determines if the user's most recent password reset was done by themselves and not issued by the System Administrator.

If yes, then the user is greeted with confetti. ðŸŽ‰

If no, then the user is logged in like normal.
